# Privacy Policy

**Telegram Share Extension** does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The extension only stores the Telegram Bot API token, chat ID, and user preferences locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.local`. No information is sent to external servers except when you explicitly send content to your configured Telegram chat through Telegram's API.

We do not track your activity, access private data, or share information with third parties.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the developer.
